*** Final Project ***


This repository contains the code I used to build a  fully-functional "ToDoList" application in Spring Boot. 

The spring framework implemented followed the "Model, View controller" method to organize and build the todo list applications. 

In order to create my todo list application, I followed the guide by Wim Deblauwe (https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2021/09/20/todomvc-with-spring-boot-and-thymeleaf-part-1/).
